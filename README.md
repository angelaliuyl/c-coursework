# CS MSc Coursework
A repository for exercises done for units in the Computer Science MSc course at UoBristol.

NB: Some of the code uploaded is written by the lecturer of the unit (e.g. files in 'General', 'boolarr.h' and 'testboolarr.c' which were used to define the exercise), some files are partially or wholly provided by the instructors (e.g. OXOGame, OXOPlayer, OXOView in OXO).
