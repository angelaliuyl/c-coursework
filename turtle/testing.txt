Testing:

Assert tests are performed right at the beginning of main to test some of the functions. asserttest.ttl is used for this. None of the tests result in termination of the program.
Makefile is used to save outputs for running the parser and interpreter for different files, explanation as below.

test1 - should fail due to lack of { at the beginning of the file
test2 - should parse OK with an empty program
test3 - should fail due to undefined instruction
test4 - should parse OK with a very long program (having to recalloc space for wds)
test5 - should fail due to lack of varnum after instruction word
test6 - should parse ok in parser, but fail in interpreter due to incorrect polish notation
test7 - should parse ok in parser, but fail in interpreter due to incorrect polish notation
test8 - should fail due to lack of ";" at the end of polish expression
test9 - should parse ok with very long polish expression (having to recalloc space on the polstack)
test10 - should fail due to variable not being a character A-Z
test11 - should fail due to variable being longer than 1 character
test12 - should parse ok in parser, but fail in interpreter due to variable not yet being set
test13 - should parse ok
test14 - should fail due to incorrectly formatted number
test15 - test18 - should fail due to incorrectly formatted DO statements
test19 - should fail due to missing } at the end of the Program
test20 - should fail due to incorrectly formatted SET statement
